## 📌 Overview
This repository contains the schematics, board layouts, and documentation for a custom, battery-powered LED blinker circuit. This project demonstrates an end-to-end hardware design process, from foundational circuit theory and simulation to a fully manufacturable Printed Circuit Board (PCB).


## ⚙️ Hardware & Circuit Design
At the core of this project is a discrete-transistor astable multivibrator circuit.

Core Logic: The design utilizes a two-transistor setup featuring 2N3904 NPN Bipolar Junction Transistors (BJTs).

Timing & Control: The alternating blink rate is dictated by precise RC timing networks and optimized current-limiting resistors.

PCB Features: The final board layout includes integrated power regulation, physical switch control, the LED arrays, and structural mounting holes for secure enclosure placement.


## 🚀 Project Process & Results

What: Designed and simulated a battery-powered LED blinker circuit before implementing it as a custom PCB.

How: Created a complete schematic and routed the PCB layout entirely within KiCad. The circuit operation was thoroughly validated through component selection and timing analysis.

Result: Successfully produced a functional PCB that reliably alternates LED blinking at a predictable and stable rate.
